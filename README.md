# Capstone-project---Prediction-of-imdbRating
The main goal of this project is to forecast the IMDb scores of films by analysing film related attributes, like genre, duration, director, cast members, and other relevant factors. 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict IMDb ratings for movies based on various movie characteristics such as genre, runtime, director, actors, and other relevant features. The specific goals include:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, convert categorical data into numerical formats, and engineer new features that may contribute to better predictions.
2. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that influence IMDb ratings and discard irrelevant or redundant features that do not add value to the prediction model.
3. Model Development: Implement multiple regression models (such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests) to predict IMDb ratings, comparing their performance using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
4. Insight Generation: Provide insights into the factors that have the most significant impact on IMDb ratings, helping to understand audience preferences and trends in movie ratings.
By achieving these objectives, the project aims to deliver a robust predictive model and a deeper understanding of the factors influencing IMDb ratings.
